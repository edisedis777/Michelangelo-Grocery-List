        <h2>About This Document</h2>
        <p>
          This remarkable document is a grocery list written by Michelangelo,
          the famous Renaissance artist known for masterpieces like the Sistine
          Chapel ceiling and the statue of David. Unlike his grand artistic
          works, this humble shopping list offers us a glimpse into his everyday
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) was a polymath of the High
          Renaissance, excelling in sculpture, painting, architecture, and
          poetry. His grocery list, while a mundane document, reflects the
          everyday life of even the most celebrated artists of the time. The
          inclusion of illustrations alongside the text highlights the practical
          challenges of communication in an era when literacy was not
          widespread.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list includes simple drawings alongside text because
          Michelangelo's servant was most likely illiterate. By including small
          sketches of the items he needed, he ensured that his servant would
          purchase the correct items at the market.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list showcases typical Italian Renaissance food items, including
          breads, wines, and fish, reflecting his diet. This document
          demonstrates how even the greatest artistic minds dealt with practical
          everyday matters.
